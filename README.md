  - Bot Permissions: `Manage Channels`, `Manage Roles`, `Manage Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`
- **File System Access**: The bot needs write permissions to create a `media_cache/` directory for temporary media storage

### Logging System
The bot logs **ALL** Discord events to the specified log channel:

#### **Message Events**
- Message creation, deletion, and editing
- Bulk message purges
- **Media caching and recovery**: Automatically caches images, videos, and audio files when messages are created, and reposts them in logs when messages are deleted

#### **Member Events**
- Joins, leaves, nickname changes
- Role additions/removals
- Bans and unbans

### Media Caching System
The bot includes an advanced media caching system that automatically:

#### **What Gets Cached**
- **Images**: All image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, etc.)
- **Videos**: Video files and GIFs
- **Audio**: Audio files and voice messages
- **Documents**: Any file attachments

#### **How It Works**
1. **Automatic Caching**: When a message with media is sent, the bot immediately downloads and caches the file locally
2. **Smart Storage**: Files are stored with unique names to prevent conflicts
3. **Recovery**: If a message with media is deleted, the bot automatically reposts the cached media in the log channel
4. **Cleanup**: Cached files are automatically deleted after being posted in logs or after 30 minutes

#### **Benefits**
- **Evidence Preservation**: Never lose deleted media content
- **Moderation Support**: See exactly what was deleted for better moderation decisions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all media that passed through your server
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No storage bloat - files are cleaned up automatically

#### **Technical Details**
- **Cache Directory**: `./media_cache/` (automatically created)
- **File Naming**: `{messageId}_{timestamp}_{originalName}`
- **Cleanup Schedule**: Every 30 minutes + on bot startup/shutdown
- **Supported Protocols**: HTTP and HTTPS downloads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if media can't be cached

#### **Server Events**
- Channel creation, updates, deletion
- Role creation, updates, deletion
- Server setting changes
- Emoji additions/removals

#### **Voice Events**
- Voice channel joins, leaves, moves

#### **Ticket Events**
- Ticket creation with reason and details
- Ticket claims and unclaims
- Ticket closure with transcript
- Archive status
